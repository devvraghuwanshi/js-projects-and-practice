           slice() returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.
           It does not modify the original array.
           Works with both positive and negative indices. 
-->

<!-- array.slice(start, end) -->

<!--
*start (optional):

Index at which to start extraction.

Default → 0.

If negative → counts from the end (-1 means last element).

*end (optional):

Index before which to end extraction (end is not included).

Default → array.length.

If negative → counts from the end.
